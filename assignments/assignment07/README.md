# Assignment 7

Sorry, I havenâ€™t had the chance to write a documentation yet. I ran out of time for both of the assignments, I spent probably too much time on cleaning the additional information on the groups, location and schedule details and I had a hard time removing duplicates and make the right connections with primary and foreign keys.

I worked together in a group with Batool and Andrew, we wanted to keep our data structures, so we decided to inform each other about our approaches and solutions.
